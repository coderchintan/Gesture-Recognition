# Gesture-Recognition
<<<<<<< HEAD
This is a simple gesture recognition script using Deep Learning.

## Requirements

For Python 2: Run ` ./RequirementsPy2.sh `

For Python 3: Run ` ./RequirementsPy3.sh `

Also Install [Open CV](https://docs.opencv.org/trunk/da/df6/tutorial_py_table_of_contents_setup.html)

## Steps

Run
` python Recognize_Gesture.py `
